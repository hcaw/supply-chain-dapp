# supply-chain-dapp

This is a decentralised application for a supply chain provenance system using Angular as the front-end framework.
All contracts are written by me unless otherwise stated.

## Ideas

Starting with a tracking system for purely proof of provenance.

Admins have the duty of governing the system, there are several admins. Some actions may require joint consent of all admins.
There are several roles in the system, each having different priveleges.
    - Producers
    - Certifiers
    - Handlers
    - ...
At the moment we will not consider aggregation of several products into one aggregate product (e.g. coffee that is a mix from several producers).

Products can be registered, but only by a registered producer.
